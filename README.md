- 👋 Hi, I’m @apaple-code
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, mainly what has been on my mind are video games and learning to code!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! (probably not for a while since I don't have much knowledge yet)
- 📫 How to reach me... you can message me on here if that is a thing? or make a change on one of my files!
